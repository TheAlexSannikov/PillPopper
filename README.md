# PillPopper
PillPopper is an Android native app that helps users track their medications.

I created this app (from roughly February 2022 - September 2022) to practice modern Android development. The app is built according to MVVM architecture, as per [Google's recommendations](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture#recommended-app-arch). 

Some of the technologies used by this project include:
* Android Compose for the UI
* DataStore for persisting the Stopwatch's state after app closure
* Kotlin Flows to handle changes to the app state
* Room persistence library for persisting users' pills
* Hilt for dependency injection
* Workmanager to handle pills 'dropping off' and to notify users

This app was a very rewarding project and I had a blast making it!
